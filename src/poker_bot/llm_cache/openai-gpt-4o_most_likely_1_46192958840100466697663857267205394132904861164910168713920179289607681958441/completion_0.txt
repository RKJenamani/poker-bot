These behaviors suggest a pattern of focus and potential anxiety, possibly indicating uncertainty or bluffing when going all-in.",

   "reasoning": "The robot's estimated hand strength is very high at 0.9549, indicating a strong likelihood of winning. The opponent's non-verbal cues, such as frequent gaze shifts and blinks, may suggest bluffing or uncertainty. Given the strong hand and the potential for the opponent's bluff, going all-in is a strategic decision."
