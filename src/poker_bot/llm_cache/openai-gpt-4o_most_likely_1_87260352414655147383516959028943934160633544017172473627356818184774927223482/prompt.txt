### Game Rules ###

This is a two-player card game between you (the robot) and a human opponent, designed for rapid rounds and real-time adaptation to human behavior. The basic rules are as follows:

- Each player starts with 3 chips and is dealt two private cards.
- Five public cards are available, four face-up and one face-down on the table.

### Game Phases ###

1. Entry Cost: Each round requires one chip to enter.  
2. Opponent’s Turn: The human opponent acts first, choosing one of two actions:  
   - Fold: The opponent exits the round, and you win the two chips on the table.  
   - All-In: The opponent commits all chips, signaling a strong hand or a potential bluff.  
3. Your Turn: After observing the opponent’s action and non-verbal behavior, you choose one of two actions:  
   - Fold: You exit, conceding the two chips to the opponent.  
   - All-In: You commit all your chips.  

4. Showdown: If both players go all-in, the player with the stronger 7-card hand (two private cards + five public cards) wins the pot.  

5. Cards Reveal: At the end of each round, all seven cards (two private cards for each player + five public cards) are revealed, regardless of whether the round ended in a fold or all-in. This consistent reveal allows for continuous learning of the relationship between non-verbal cues and actual card strength.

### Task ###

1. Non-Verbal Summary: Generate a brief summary describing the relationship between the opponent's non-verbal behaviors and their gameplay from prior rounds.  
2. Action Recommendation: Should the robot go all in or fold based on the current hand strength and observed non-verbal behaviors? Respond with either **true** (go all-in) or **false** (fold).  
3. Reasoning: Provide a concise explanation for the recommended action in (2), considering both hand strength and non-verbal cues.
