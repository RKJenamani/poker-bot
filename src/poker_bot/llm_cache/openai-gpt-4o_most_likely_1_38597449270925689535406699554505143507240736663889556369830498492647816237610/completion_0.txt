   "non_verbal_summary": "The opponent consistently exhibits a high level of gaze at cards (60%) and moderate gaze at the robot (15%), with frequent gaze shifts (8/s) and blinks (12/s). These behaviors have been consistent across rounds, regardless of hand strength, suggesting a potential bluffing strategy or nervousness.",
   "go_all_in": true,
   "reasoning": "The robot's estimated hand strength is very high at 0.9802, indicating a strong potential to win. The opponent's non-verbal cues have not reliably indicated strong hands in previous rounds, as they have gone all-in with both weak and strong hands. Given the robot's strong hand and the opponent's inconsistent non-verbal signals, going all-in is a strategic decision."
