   "non_verbal_summary": "The opponent consistently exhibits a high percentage of gaze at cards (60%) and a moderate level of gaze shifts (8/s) and head pose shifts (5/s), with a relatively high blink rate (12/s). These behaviors suggest a focus on evaluating their hand and the situation, possibly indicating confidence or an attempt to mask uncertainty.",

   "reasoning": "The robot's estimated hand strength is very high at 0.9549, indicating a strong likelihood of winning. The opponent's non-verbal cues have been consistent across rounds, showing no clear signs of bluffing or weakness. Given the strong hand and lack of deceptive non-verbal indicators, going all-in is a strategically sound decision."
